# Question 1
***
	A hypothetical client has sent you an email (shown in the **Q1 Email** section), asking for you to build them a website. Write an appropriate, professional email response that shows your understanding of the client’s needs for the website, an understanding of appropriate technologies or tools needed to build the website yourself, as well as an understanding of how a team of web developers collaborates and works in the creation of a website.

```
Hello there!

My name is Alex, and I’m the director of the Super Awesome Museum (SAM). We display a variety of interesting artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia about all sorts of things from all over the world.

I’m writing to you because the SAM needs a website. The museum is new in the city, we’re fully funded and don’t sell our items but we just need to encourage people to visit the museum.

We would need a website that showcases some of our interesting exhibits and items, helps people find their way to the museum, and helps people contact the museum.

We would like to have an initial meeting with you to discuss two items:

- An explanation of the software you use in the process of creating a website.
- Understand how your team operates.

We don’t know much about this website stuff - does this sound like something that you can do? 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alex

Director

Super Awesome Museum

Dear Alex,

Thank you for getting in touch with us regarding the opportunity to collaborate on the Super Awesome Museum website. I can tell straight away from a quirky name like "Super Awesome Museum" that the SAM and Viking Webforge will be a tight fit! 

Along with a sense of humour, we share a passion for projects that enrich the life of the community through delivering quality educational experiences. 

Based on your initial email, I would glean that your goals are focused on:

1. Creating a visually engaging website that highlights the exhibits and events  your museum has to offer.
2. Creates an easy way for potential visitors to find and determine their best mode of transport to the SAM
3. Creates an easy way for potential visitors to contact your team and stay in touch about upcoming exhibits and events. 


Together, we can create an inviting and interactive online environment that will augment your artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia while also being a communication hub for you to introduce yourselves to the new neighbourhood and drive business through the doors! 

I would be more than happy to have a meeting to discuss our team, the tools we use, our design and implementation process. 

In the spirit of being educational and in the interest of maximising our time in person, I've compiled a brief summary.

#### Technologies and Software for the SAM website:

Viking Webforge is a company that specialises in Full Stack Web Development, meaning that we design both the user interface (Frontend) as well as the database, resources, and hosting (Backend) of your website.  

##### Frontend vs Backend

* Frontend: When you hear the word "website", you're more than likely thinking of what we call the frontend. This is the user interface. What people see on their screen and what they interact with, be that the layout, images, buttons, forms, animations etc. This is where are artistic flair is on show for all to see. Here is where we can 

Our preferred Tech Stack (our "tools of the trade") is a collection of pieces of software integrated together known as the MERN stack, which will ensure your website is dynamic, responsive (works on both mobile and desktop), and scalable .  

MERN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS.

* MongoDB: is a highly scalable, non-Relational Database that will store all the information related to your exhibits. It is good for storing and retrieving very large amounts data about just about anything. This could include but is not limited to data about your displays, past and future events, customer contact details, a booking system, educational resources and much more. The Database can grow with the SAM.
  
* ExpressJS: This is the backend framework that will handle all of the server-side functionality. This would include the routing between the Database and the User Interface (the webpage that your visitors see). It would handle form submissions on your contact page as well.
  
* ReactJS: This is the framework we use to make the most interactive and engaging user experience possible. Through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the React Framework we can create a very fast loading, modern and easy to navigate website. We could create immersive museum tours, interactive maps, carousels of photos to showcase your many artefacts, contact pages, educational resources, all right on your homepage if you wish. We can make your website responsive, so it works just as well on a mobile phone or tablet as it does on a desktop computer or smart board. We can also integrate Search Engine Optimisation, so that your community is finding out about the museum in when they search things like "Museums near me".
  
* NodeJS: This is the server side package that allows the frontend of your website to communicate with the backend. It also allows us to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, allowing our developers to become highly skilled with a streamlined language for all elements of our projects. Node will ensure the SAM has a fast-building website that will respond to user inputs without delays.
