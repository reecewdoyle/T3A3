# Question 1
***
	A hypothetical client has sent you an email (shown in the **Q1 Email** section), asking for you to build them a website. Write an appropriate, professional email response that shows your understanding of the client’s needs for the website, an understanding of appropriate technologies or tools needed to build the website yourself, as well as an understanding of how a team of web developers collaborates and works in the creation of a website.

```
Hello there!

My name is Alex, and I’m the director of the Super Awesome Museum (SAM). We display a variety of interesting artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia about all sorts of things from all over the world.

I’m writing to you because the SAM needs a website. The museum is new in the city, we’re fully funded and don’t sell our items but we just need to encourage people to visit the museum.

We would need a website that showcases some of our interesting exhibits and items, helps people find their way to the museum, and helps people contact the museum.

We would like to have an initial meeting with you to discuss two items:

- An explanation of the software you use in the process of creating a website.
- Understand how your team operates.

We don’t know much about this website stuff - does this sound like something that you can do? 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alex

Director

Super Awesome Museum

Dear Alex,

Thank you for getting in touch with us regarding the opportunity to collaborate on the Super Awesome Museum website. I can tell straight away from a quirky name like "Super Awesome Museum" that the SAM and Viking Webforge will be a tight fit! 

Along with a sense of humour, we share a passion for projects that enrich the life of the community through delivering quality educational experiences. 

Based on your initial email, I would glean that your goals are focused on:

1. Creating a visually engaging website that highlights the exhibits and events your museum has to offer.
2. Creates an easy way for potential visitors to find and determine their best mode of transport to the SAM
3. Creates an easy way for potential visitors to contact your team and stay in touch about upcoming exhibits and events. 

Together, we can create an inviting and interactive online environment that will augment your artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia while also being a communication hub for you to introduce yourselves to the new neighbourhood and drive business through the doors! 

I would be more than happy to have a meeting to discuss our team, the tools we use, our design and implementation process. 

In the spirit of being educational and in the interest of maximising our time in person, I've compiled a brief summary.

#### Technologies and Software for the SAM website:

Viking Webforge is a company that specialises in Full Stack Web Development, meaning that we design both the user interface (Frontend) as well as the database, resources, and hosting (Backend) of your website.  

##### Frontend vs Backend

* Frontend: When you hear the word "website", you're more than likely thinking of what we call the frontend. This is the user interface. What people see on their screen and what they interact with, be that the layout, images, logos, buttons, forms, animations etc. This is where our artistic flair and design skills come to flourish! It's also where the SAM will be able to express it's sense of humour as a quirky and lighthearted den of high quality education!
  
* Backend: This is the boring stuff that our team oddly still finds quite enjoyable! The behind the scenes functionality that your visitors don't really need or want to see, but is essential in creating that interactive user experience we're seeking in a modern, interactive web application. It's where all the functionality for the website is handled, like the storing and retrieving of data about your exhibits, processing of contact forms, and managing bookings. Frontend will make sure that there is a button to click. Backend will make sure that when that button is clicked, a thing happens, and it happens quickly!

##### The MERN Stack

Our preferred Tech Stack (our "tools of the trade") is a collection of pieces of software integrated together known as the MERN stack, which will ensure your website is dynamic, responsive (works on both mobile and desktop), and scalable .  

MERN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS.

* MongoDB: is a highly scalable, non-Relational Database that will store all the information related to your exhibits. It is good for storing and retrieving very large amounts of data about just about anything. This could include but is not limited to data about your displays, past and future events, customer contact details, a booking system, educational resources and much more. The Database can grow with the SAM.
  
* ExpressJS: This is the backend framework that will handle all of the server-side functionality. This would include the routing between the Database and the User Interface (the webpage that your visitors see). It would handle form submissions on your contact page as well.
  
* React: This is the framework we use to make the most interactive and engaging user experience possible. Through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the React Framework we can create a very fast loading, modern and easy to navigate website. We could create immersive museum tours, interactive maps, carousels of photos to showcase your many artefacts, contact pages, educational resources, all right on your homepage if you wish. We can make your website responsive, meaning it adjusts to the size and orientation of the screen it is being viewed on. Your website will look and function just as well on a smart phone or tablet as it does on a desktop computer or smart board. 
  
* NodeJS: This is the server side package that allows the frontend of your website to communicate with the backend. It also allows us to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, allowing our developers to become highly skilled with a streamlined language for all elements of our projects. Node will ensure the SAM has a fast-building website that will respond to user inputs without delays. 

##### Search Engine Optimisation

We can also integrate Search Engine Optimisation, so that your community is finding out about the museum in when they search things like "Museums near me", or when they search for particular items that you may have in your catalogue. We can optimise with meta tags, titles and descriptions, while also insuring that the page loads quickly to make sure the page is noticed by search engine crawlers to improve visibility in searches and improve rankings. This can be tracked by integrating Google Analytics to provide real-time data on how many people visit your webpage, how long they stay for, what pages do they look at, and what do they click on, allowing for further optimisation of your website. 

#### Collaboration

All projects at Viking Webforge follow a structure that can more-or-less be broken down into 7 steps:

#### 1. Information Gathering
You've already begun this step by reaching out to us! This is our first contact with a potential client where we get to know each other. We learn a bit about your museum and determine the core features you require from your website, such as galleries, events calendars, contact forms, any branding guidelines or logos you'd like to incorporate, who your target audience is as well as timeline and budget. 

#### 2. Planning
Once we've decided to work together, this is when we have another meeting to put pen to paper and plan. We set goals and timelines with you, which some like to call the "development roadmap". This will give us the opportunity to go into greater detail for what the website will look. We go back to our team and start breaking the project down into task. We use a Khanban board app called Trello which allows us to break each task into small steps on individual cards, delegate them to our developers, track any issues that come up, and track when each task is completed. 

At this point we like to create a very basic sitemap so we can determine exactly how many pages your website is going to have, and how you will navigate them. 

The final stage is that we start to create wireframes with an app called Figma. These are very simple sketches of what the layout of each page will be. Sometimes these are black and white, sometimes they have some basic colours, but they are just pictures of the pages that give you the opportunity to approve our basic ideas before we move into the design phase. 

#### 3. Design
This is the phase where we start to design what your page will actually look like. This is when the actual logos, images, and branding guidelines are created. You make decisions on fonts, colours, button designs, size of images and everything that goes on the page. We have members of our team that specialise in UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) who make sure that we're creating a useable website that's going to do what you want it to do and look the way it should within the capabilities of the technology. This is a process where we send designs to you, you send back feedback, and we tweak designs until you're completely satisfied. 

I imagine that you're going to want some of your items to be cataloged in your database, so this will also be when we start to design the API An API (Application Programming Interface) is something we create for you that allows your database to talk to your user interface. This is how information will be created, retrieved, updated or deleted in your system. 

This is one of those big, boring, backend things that's not intended to be visually stimulating, yet still brings overwhelming satisfaction to our developers. We have some developers in our team that greatly prefer this to UI/UX, so that's what they mostly focus on.  

#### 4. Content Writing 
This is when we make sure that you've got all the content that you want to go on your website to us. This is mostly the text based content, much of which will end up in the database, accessed by the API that we designed in the previous step. We'll guide you with the most efficient formate to send the data to us. We can do our best and try to make up some cool facts about the things found in the SAM, but from experience, we feel that this part is best handled by the experts; you! 

#### 5. Coding!
Once you've approved everything we've designed, sent through all your content and assets, we get to work coding! We generally start with the homepage, and then work one subsequent pages. At this point, all of the initial creative decisions have been made. We go away for a bit until we have our first version of the website ready for you to begin testing. 

During this development phase, every line of code that our developers write is tracked by a version control application called Git, and stored and shared through an online platform called GitHub. It allows every version of every page we create to be tracked, checked, tested and approved by our senior developers before it is approved to be added to the release version of your website. It's actually quite ingenious. It is extremely robust, and makes it almost impossible to lose anything! 

if we make a change that breaks something, or makes something ugly, we can simply restore from a previous commit that we know worked and was not ugly. It's extremely handy!
#### 6. Testing, Review and Launch
This is the point where we have a working version of the website. We test for it's compatibility across multiple devices (tablets, smartphones, desktops) and browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.). We test that every link, and feature works. At this point you'll also have a chance to see how the site functions and looks and let us know if there's any last minute changes. 
NB: There is almost always changes. It's okay to change your mind on things!
Once the site has been reviewed and iterated on, deploy the site for launch! 

#### 7. Maintenance and updating.
Over time, the website will obviously ned to be updated and
