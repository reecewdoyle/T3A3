# Question 1
***
	A hypothetical client has sent you an email (shown in the **Q1 Email** section), asking for you to build them a website. Write an appropriate, professional email response that shows your understanding of the client’s needs for the website, an understanding of appropriate technologies or tools needed to build the website yourself, as well as an understanding of how a team of web developers collaborates and works in the creation of a website.

Hello there!

My name is Alex, and I’m the director of the Super Awesome Museum (SAM). We display a variety of interesting artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia about all sorts of things from all over the world.

I’m writing to you because the SAM needs a website. The museum is new in the city, we’re fully funded and don’t sell our items but we just need to encourage people to visit the museum.

We would need a website that showcases some of our interesting exhibits and items, helps people find their way to the museum, and helps people contact the museum.

We would like to have an initial meeting with you to discuss two items:

- An explanation of the software you use in the process of creating a website.
- Understand how your team operates.

We don’t know much about this website stuff - does this sound like something that you can do? 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alex

Director

Super Awesome Museum
