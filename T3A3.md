# Question 1
***
	A hypothetical client has sent you an email (shown in the **Q1 Email** section), asking for you to build them a website. Write an appropriate, professional email response that shows your understanding of the client’s needs for the website, an understanding of appropriate technologies or tools needed to build the website yourself, as well as an understanding of how a team of web developers collaborates and works in the creation of a website.

```
Hello there!

My name is Alex, and I’m the director of the Super Awesome Museum (SAM). We display a variety of interesting artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia about all sorts of things from all over the world.

I’m writing to you because the SAM needs a website. The museum is new in the city, we’re fully funded and don’t sell our items but we just need to encourage people to visit the museum.

We would need a website that showcases some of our interesting exhibits and items, helps people find their way to the museum, and helps people contact the museum.

We would like to have an initial meeting with you to discuss two items:

- An explanation of the software you use in the process of creating a website.
- Understand how your team operates.

We don’t know much about this website stuff - does this sound like something that you can do? 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alex

Director

Super Awesome Museum

Dear Alex,

Thank you for getting in touch with us regarding the opportunity to collaborate on the Super Awesome Museum website. I can tell straight away from a quirky name like "Super Awesome Museum" that the SAM and Viking Webforge will be a tight fit! 

Along with a sense of humour, we share a passion for projects that enrich the life of the community through delivering quality educational experiences. 

Based on your initial email, I would glean that your goals are focused on creating: 

1. A visually engaging website that highlights the exhibits and events your museum has to offer.
2. An easy way for potential visitors to find and determine their best mode of transport to the SAM
3. An efficient method for potential visitors to contact your team and stay in touch about upcoming exhibits and events. 

Together, we can create an inviting and interactive online environment that will augment your artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia while also being a communication hub for you to introduce yourselves to the new neighbourhood and drive business through the doors! 

I would be more than happy to have a meeting to discuss our team, the tools we use, our design and implementation process. 

In the spirit of being educational and in the interest of maximising our time in person, I've compiled a document attached that will give you a detailed description of how Viking Webforge can work with the SAM to deliver the best website possible.

Please let me know your availability for an initial meeting where I would be happy to discuss any further questions you have. 

If you're also new to the area, I can also recommend a few good venues for such a meeting. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Warm Regards,

Reece Doyle

#### Technologies and Software for the SAM website:

Viking Webforge is a company that specialises in Full Stack Web Development, meaning that we design both the user interface (Frontend) as well as the database, resources, and hosting (Backend) of your website.  

##### Frontend vs Backend

* Frontend: When you hear the word "website", you're more than likely thinking of what we call the frontend. This is the user interface. What people see on their screen and what they interact with, be that the layout, images, logos, buttons, forms, animations etc. This is where our artistic flair and design skills come to flourish! It's also where the SAM will be able to express it's sense of humour as a quirky and lighthearted den of high quality education!
  
* Backend: This is the boring stuff that our team oddly still finds quite enjoyable! The behind the scenes functionality that your visitors don't really need or want to see, but is essential in creating that interactive user experience we're seeking in a modern, interactive web application. It's where all the functionality for the website is handled, like the storing and retrieving of data about your exhibits, processing of contact forms, and managing bookings. 

Frontend will make sure that there is a button to click. Backend will make sure that when that button is clicked, a thing happens, and it happens quickly!

##### The MERN Stack

Our preferred Tech Stack (our "tools of the trade") is a collection of pieces of software integrated together known as the MERN stack, which will ensure your website is dynamic, responsive (works on both mobile and desktop), and scalable .  

MERN is an acronym for MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS.

* MongoDB: is a highly scalable, non-Relational Database that will store all the information related to your exhibits. It is good for storing and retrieving very large amounts of data about just about anything. This could include but is not limited to data about your displays, past and future events, customer contact details, a booking system, educational resources and much more. The Database can grow with the SAM. 
  
* ExpressJS: This is the backend framework that will handle all of the server-side functionality. This would include the routing between the Database and the User Interface (the webpage that your visitors see). It would handle form submissions on your contact page as well. It also inserts something called middleware, which ensures your data is processed safely and securely. 
  
* React: This is the framework we use to make the most interactive and engaging user experience possible. Through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the React Framework we can create a very fast loading, modern and easy to navigate website. We could create immersive museum tours, interactive maps, carousels of photos to showcase your many artefacts, contact pages, educational resources, all right on your homepage if you wish. We can make your website responsive, meaning it adjusts to the size and orientation of the screen it is being viewed on. Your website will look and function just as well on a smart phone or tablet as it does on a desktop computer or smart board. 
  
* NodeJS: This is the server side package that allows the frontend of your website to communicate with the backend. It also allows us to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, allowing our developers to become highly skilled with a streamlined language for all elements of our projects. Node will ensure the SAM has a fast-building website that will respond to user inputs without delays. 

##### Search Engine Optimisation

We can also integrate Search Engine Optimisation, so that your community is finding out about the museum in when they search things like "Museums near me", or when they search for particular items that you may have in your catalogue. We can optimise with meta tags, titles and descriptions. Our tech stack allows your website to load very quickly, and work on mobile devices, which are both things that search engine crawlers look for to improve your visibility in searches and improve rankings. This can be tracked by integrating Google Analytics to provide real-time data on how many people visit your webpage, how long they stay for, what pages do they look at, and what do they click on, allowing for further optimisation of your website.

#### Collaboration

All projects at Viking Webforge follow a structure that can more-or-less be broken down into 7 steps:
![Web Development Checklist](web-dev-list.png)
#### 1. Information Gathering (1-2 weeks)
You've already begun this step by reaching out to us! This is our first contact with a potential client where we get to know each other. We learn a bit about your museum and determine the core features you require from your website, such as galleries, events calendars, contact forms, any branding guidelines or logos you'd like to incorporate, who your target audience is as well as timeline and budget. 

#### 2. Planning (2-6 weeks)
Once we've decided to work together, this is when we have another meeting to put pen to paper and plan. We set goals and timelines with you, which some like to call the "development roadmap". This will give us the opportunity to go into greater detail for what the website will look like. We go back to our team and start breaking the project down into task. We use a Kanban board app called Trello which allows us to break each task into small steps on individual cards, delegate them to our developers, track any issues that come up, and track when each task is completed. 

At this point we like to create a very basic sitemap, which determines the structure of your website and how users will navigate between pages. This way we can determine exactly how many pages your website is going to have, and the path the user will take to navigate through them. For example, you might want every page accessible via a link form the homepage, or you might only want a smaller selection viewable. 

The final stage is that we start to create wireframes with an app called Figma. These are very simple sketches of what the layout of each page will be. Sometimes these are black and white, sometimes they have some basic colours, but they are just pictures of the pages that give you the opportunity to approve our basic ideas before we move into the design phase. 

#### 3. Design (4-12 weeks)
This is the phase where we start to design what your page will actually look like. This is when the actual logos, images, and branding guidelines are created. You make decisions on fonts, colours, button designs, size of images and everything that goes on the page. We have members of our team that specialise in UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) who make sure that we're creating a useable website that's going to do what you want it to do and look the way it should within the capabilities of the technology. This is a process where we send designs to you, you send back feedback, and we tweak designs until you're completely satisfied. 

I imagine that you're going to want some of your items to be cataloged in your database, so this will also be when we start to design the API. An API (Application Programming Interface) is something we create for you that allows your database to talk to your user interface. This is how information will be created, read, updated or deleted in your system. This would also allow you to share information about your exhibits with other organisations in the future. 

This is one of those big, backend things that's not intended to be visually stimulating, yet still brings overwhelming satisfaction to our developers. We have some developers in our team that greatly prefer this to UI/UX, so that's what they mostly focus on.  

#### 4. Content Writing (5-15 weeks)
This is when we make sure that you've got all the content that you want to go on your website to us. This is mostly the text based content. 

Most of the information about your exhibits will end up in the database, accessed by the API that we designed in the previous step. 

For example, let's say you have a Viking's Toothbrush you might like to store information about in your database. While you see a bright and colourful page with a bright picture and a nice font, this is what your database will store:

```json
{ 
	"item_id": "001", 
	"name": "Viking's Toothbrush", 
	"category": "Historical Artefact", 
	"description": "An ancient Viking-era toothbrush, believed to have been carved from a whale bone and used with herbal pastes. Surprisingly ergonomic for its time!", 
	"origin": { 
		"region": "Scandinavia", 
		"estimated_year": 975, 
		"discovered_at": "Norwegian coast", 
		"discovered_by": "Dr. Ingrid Yngvar" 
	}, 
	"dimensions": { 
		"length_cm": 12.5, 
		"width_cm": 1.8, 
		"weight_g": 50 
		},
```

Don't worry if that looks a little daunting. We don't expect you to create that code. We'll do that. We'll guide you with the most efficient formate to send the data to us. 

#### 5. Coding! (6-15 weeks)
Once you've approved everything we've designed, sent through all your content and assets, we get to work coding! We generally start with the homepage, and then work one subsequent pages. At this point, all of the initial creative decisions have been made. We go away for a bit until we have our first version of the website ready for you to begin testing. 

During this development phase, every line of code that our developers write is tracked by a version control application called Git, and stored and shared through an online platform called GitHub. It allows every version of every page we create to be tracked, checked, tested and approved by our senior developers before it is approved to be added to the release version of your website. It's actually quite ingenious. It is extremely robust, and makes it almost impossible to lose anything! 

if we make a change that breaks something, or makes something ugly, we can simply restore from a previous commit that we know worked and was not ugly. It's extremely handy!

#### 6. Testing, Review and Launch (2-4 weeks)
This is the point where we have a working version of the website. We test for it's compatibility across multiple devices (tablets, smartphones, desktops) and browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.), as well as testing the accessibility of your page for people with disabilities. We test that every link, and feature works. At this point you'll also have a chance to see how the site functions and looks and let us know if there's any last minute changes. 
NB: There is almost always changes. It's okay to change your mind on things!
Once the site has been reviewed and iterated on, deploy the site for launch! 

#### 7. Maintenance and updating (ongoing)
Over time, the website will obviously need to be updated and and expanded. We continue to deliver ongoing support for any updates, security patches or new features you need to build in the future. We can also make use the data we get from Google Analytics to determine what parts of the site might need to change to better fulfil it's purpose to educate, connect, and entertain.

ITP1001-7.1: Q6: IDENTIFIES and EXPLAINS multiple skills needed in a professional information technology environment.

##### IDENTIFIES MULTIPLE skills relevant to a professional information technology environment, and provides a DETAILED EXPLANATION about EACH of the identified skills.

***
Working effectively in a software development environment requires a high level of many soft and hard skills. Each skill will play a different crucial role in advancing your career by contributing to your teams productivity. 

#### Soft Skills

Soft skills are personal attributes that spill over to every aspect of your life, but are especially important in the workplace. They're about how you interact within your team and workplace. 

##### Communication

* Developers need to be effective communicators with both technical and non-technical stakeholders and teammates. The need to be able to describe the same concept in several different ways, but also be very precise with what is required for a particular goal to meet a deadline. The better the communicator, the fewer misunderstandings, the more effective the employee. 
##### Collaboration

* It's rare for software development to be an individual endeavour, therefore to be effective, you must be good at working within a team environment. Collaborative skills allow a developer to work efficiently with others, share ideas, an contribute to collective problem solving.  You need to be patient with others that might have fewer skills and experience, but also be willing to learn from those more senior. You need to be comfortable asking questions, as well as being able to give and  receive constructive feedback gracefully. It also helps to be pleasant to be around, as you'll be spending a lot of time together and this is key to building positive relationships with all stakeholders. 
##### Problem Solving

* A large part of the job as a developer is finding solutions to challenges in a creative and efficient manner. This involves a lot of critical and creative thinking. It's one thing to know what a piece of code does, but it's quite another thing to know when it can be applied to a situation. There would also be a certain element of calculated risk taking, as there is a possibility that you could be spending a good amount of time on a solution that doesn't work. These skills are important for both writing code, and debugging code that already exists. 
##### Time Management

* This is crucial when juggling multiple tasks and deadlines at a time. You need to be able to prioritise tasks to meet the deadlines in the right time and the right order so you're not holding anyone else up with your work. This ties in with collaboration. You also need to be able to set realistic expectations of yourself and not leave large chunks of work to till the last minute. This leads to stress and burnout which can have some very serious negative effects on your longterm health and effectiveness within the team. 
##### Adaptability

* Technology is in a constant state of flux, meaning that there is always going to be new tools, programming languages and processes to learn. There is also always going to be new problems to solve in new fields. Successful devs are able to adapt to ever changing environments and settings by keeping up with new knowledge, skills and tools that are changing industry standards. You also may need to be able to adapt to legacy code in older projects that you might not have seen before. 


#### Hard Skills

Hard skills are the highly teachable and job specific attributes required to be a successful developer. These are skills that could be specific to a particular role or industry. These are measurable technical abilities that a developer must have to be effective. 

##### Programming Languages

* This would relate to both the specific languages a dev is proficient in (Python, JavaScript, Java, C# etc.), but also the ability to write easy to understand D.R.Y code that is as efficient and easy as possible to debug. It's also about knowing the best language to solve for the best use case (Python is better for analytics, JavaScript is better for web development). It's also knowing about best practices. You can technically put all of your code in a single file and it will work, but this has a negative impact on readability and workability. Best practice would be breaking up code into multiple files (preferably a file per task), with detailed and useful comments. 

##### Version Control

* Version Control is essential for tracking changes and collaborating within a team. Using Git and GitHub allow team members to share code that they need to collaborate on from a central spot. It also allows senior engineers to approve versions of the code once it's been throughly checked. Using GitHub properly allows a team to find conflicts, roll back mistakes and problem solve together. It's also a very effective way to backup the work from a task should there be technical issues with a local machine. It's also a place where packages that have been created by a developer can be shared with the wider development community to make use of and iterate over. 
##### Database Management

* Database management is critical for developing the backend of websites. Outside of some very basic websites, there is a high probability that you're going to need to efficiently create, read, update and delete entries in some form of database. This could either be a relational database like SQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
